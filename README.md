##Module 6 Challenge

### Assignment Summary
This project explores how weather patterns change as we approach the equator. Using Python, we accessed data from the OpenWeatherMap API to collect weather information from over 500 cities worldwide. By analyzing variables like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed, we created visualizations to show the relationship between each variable and latitude.
